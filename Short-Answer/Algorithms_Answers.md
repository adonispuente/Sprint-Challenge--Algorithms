#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) its linear, the bigger n is, the more it has to perform. so if n is 2, a =4 , and then a = 8. (a finally became greater than n*n*n being 8)

b)O(n^2), because you have a nest while loop inside of a for loop. Youre performing an action inside of another action n amount of times

c)O(n), its linear, its just perform the function as many times as there are bunnys

## Exercise II

I think I would go with a binary search route which would most likely be O(log n) or best case scenario O(1). I would start at the mid point, and if the egg breaks there, move higher up in stories (grab that mid point and repeat), if it didnt break then I would go to the left using the same logic until I got to the exact floor I was looking for.
